  - **Data Preparation:**

    - Aggregation and reshaping data (wide-to-long, long-to-wide) using pandas functions like groupby(), stack(), unstack(), and pivot().
    - Creating calculated columns (e.g., quarters) using utilities like numpy.where().

   
  - **Visualizations:**

    - Bar charts comparing sales by regions and years.
    - Pie charts illustrating the composition of sales by region, quarter, and customer tier.
    - Comparative analysis of sales trends and declines for specific regions, states, and customer divisions.
    - Faceted visualizations for detailed quarterly and tier-specific trends.


  - **Analytical Insights:**

    - Region-wise and tier-wise comparisons for sales across 2015 and 2016.
    - Identifying states and divisions with sales declines.
    - Quarter-wise breakdown of sales across multiple categories.


  - **Sample Outputs Included:**

    - Bar charts for year-over-year regional sales comparisons.
    - Pie charts detailing the sales composition across different dimensions.
    - Visual trends for quarter-specific sales data.
